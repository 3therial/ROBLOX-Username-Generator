# ROBLOX Username Finder

Tool that generates random ROBLOX usernames by checking if they are already taken using ROBLOX's WebAPI. Found usernames will be sent to your Discord Server using a webhook if you have the setting enabled.

    • It's really easy, all you need is a discord webhook. Well you dont even need that

    • It will not send claimed usernames so don't worry .


## Requirements

[Node.js **v18.13.0**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or newer

**I recommend** using something like [**notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.4.9/) to edit the config.js 
## Setup

(will make a step by step yt video soon, i'll put the link here.)
1) Download [Node.js **v18.13.0**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or newer
2) once installed, we will now need to install some npm thingies. Open cmd and run these:
 `npm install discord.js`\
  `npm install --save requests`\
   `npm install express`

3) now that that is all installed, Download this repostitory as a zip, extract it and open the folder. here you should see the following; `index.js`, `config.js`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `title.txt.`

4) Right click anywhere and click `Open in Terminal`, it will then open cmd. Now run `node index.js`

## Make sure to
- Configure `config.js`
- Add a webhook if you'd  like
